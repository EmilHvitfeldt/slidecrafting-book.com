## Highlight incremental slides

The use of [incremental lists](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/#incremental-lists) is a great way to add a little something to a set of slides. It also avoids a wall of text, allowing the presenter to show one bullet at a time. All in all, this is helpful as it can be used to focus the viewers' attention. 

As a reminder, we create an incremental list using the following syntax:

```markdown
::: {.incremental}
- thing 1
- thing 2
:::
```

We can add another class to this div and use it to style it more. 

```markdown
::: {.incremental .highlight-last}
- thing 1
- thing 2
:::
```

then we use this to style our list. Below `.current-fragment` refers to the last shown item in the list. Setting the `color: grey` isn't necessary, but it is a way to downplay the "not-current" items

```scss
.highlight-last  {
  color: grey;
  .current-fragment {
    color: #5500ff;
  }
}
```

These together yield these slides:

<iframe class="slide-deck" src="../examples/fragments/tip-1.html">

</iframe>

<a href="../examples/fragments/tip-1.qmd" target="_blank" class="listing-slides btn-links">{{< fa file >}}qmd<a>
<a href="../examples/fragments/tip-1.scss" target="_blank" class="listing-video btn-links">{{< fa brands sass >}}scss<a>
